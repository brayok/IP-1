        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Brian Munyinyi Kamau</strong> I was born in 27th October 1997.My Parents are Francis Kamau and Lydiah Wanjiru. I attended Wahundura High School and later on Moringa School where I am currently studying. Our home is at Gatundu South in Kiambu County in Kenya. I have worked in different industries as a casual labourer to sustain my living and hope to get a formal job after I graduate. </p>
        <p>I joined programming because I've always wanted to develop applications but lacked the knowledge and resources. Moringa has been of great help to me since I now get first hand programming knowledge from Moringa's staff who will be of great help to me in achieving my programming dream.</p>
        <p>After Moringa School I expect to gain programming experience that I will use to satisfy my application development interests by developing functioning and reliable applications.</p>
